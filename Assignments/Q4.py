# QUESTION 4
# Create a program that stores Employee objects in Problem 3 in a dictionary. 	Use the Employee ID number as the key. The program should present a menu 	that lets the user perform the following operations:
 	
# Look up an employee in the dictionary
 		
# Add a new employee in the dictionary
 		
# Change an existing employeeâ€™s name, department, and job title in the 	dictionary
 		
# Delete an employee from the dictionary
 		
# Quit the program
